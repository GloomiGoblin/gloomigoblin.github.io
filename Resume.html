<h2 style="color:#a766a7"> Introduction </h2>


<p style="color:#bb6a93" id="pageone">As I continued my education at Oxnard 
College, I became more interested in technical fields like Physics and Engineering. 
After taking a MATLAB course, a program used for Engineering, my interest in Computer Science 
was peaked as the programming aspect in MATLAB appealed to me much more than did the application 
uses for engineering projects.</p>
